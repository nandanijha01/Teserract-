# Tesseract-
I have tried to visualize 4th dimension object (https://github.com/nandanijha01/Teserract-/blob/main/tesseract.gif) by animating it. And I have taken projection of 3D on 2D and by rotating it one can visualize the 4th dimension.
I have done this work in jupyter notebook by using matplotlib and various other libraries.
